Day 1 - lab prep

- Check Safety and authorization BSL-2 and SOPs
- Aim for 3-5 clear orthogonal phenotypes plus one confirmation ID
- Set up uni-directional workflow from dirty to clean
- Get chains of custody and deviation forms ready
- Color-code racks and pens by sample, keep notebooks and laptops in clean zone
- Ensure PPE equipment is available to be used throughout the 5 days experiment
- pre-print labels to avoid handwriting over open plates
- Prepare plan for spill/exposure/waste response steps posted on bench
- Pre-book confirmation ID slot with the core lab
- Pre-arrange packaging/transport per institution SOPs,
- Pre-label plates for NA, TSA,MAC,MYP and TSA+5% with IDs and dilution IDs
- Set up consumables in place, disinfect the bench and set up unidirectional workflow
- Lock in blanks, process blanks and an internal comparator document acceptance criteria
- Check permissions to preparing a 10 mL suspension

Day 2 -initial screening

- Process soil into clarified suspension to reduce flora, track dilutions
- Process blanks plates alongside sample
- Time stamped photos on first observation to capture colony
- Label on plate as "no touch" to detect environment change
- Plate dilutions series onto panel to allow recovery(NA/TSA) to suppress Gram positives (MAC; for comparison) visualize differential traits (MYP,TSA+5% SB)
- Physically segregate by condition and sample, clearly labelled and logged
- Obs: Change gloves between tasks, keep plates sealed when not handling, separate work areas

Day 3 - Colony Triage

- Examine plates for colony types matte/rough, betahemolysis on TSA+5% SB, lecithinase-positive opaque zones on egg-yolk media (MYP) and lack of mannitol fermentation on MYP background
- A second single-colony purification pass before any downstream checks
- Create matrix traits to be used on decision matrix
- Use simple decision matrix traits vs candidates with pass/fail threshold
- Assign unique lineage IDs and move only one candidate at a time
- Run a Gram strain on good candidates, look for large Gram-positive rods may show spores,
- Log high-quality images of plates and stains, write all findings, discoveries in the decision log

Day 4 - Secondary Check

- Confirm purity on plates and decide if it needs another isolation pass
- Perform simple bench characterization without giving operation parameters
- Retain a backup plate at 4C
- Submit pre-booked sample to accredited ID; document chain-of-custody
- Obs: use fresh sterile tools for each colony, maintain strict plate and tool segregation and negative controls

Day 5 - Planning preparation

- Define success criteria for the 10 mL deliverables in writing before receipt
- Archive a small retention sample per policy and schedule any required stability checks
- Review confirmation ID sample sent to accredited lab
- Coordinate with institution everything is done according to thei regulation and SOPs.
- Document concentration units, viability, storage and transport
- Verify preparation, log chain of custody, concentration, identity and QC certificate numbers
- Perform non-culturing checks permitted by your SOPs, record all findings on lab notebook
- Complete closeout audit: surfaces, incubators, waste logs, inventory reconciliation
