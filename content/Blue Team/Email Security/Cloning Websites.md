Websites can be easily clone by registering a domain with the identical name, except we would replace one or a few of the characters on the domain with another character from a different allowed language  (ie: Malayalam,Thai,Greek,Latin )

Using those characters we can purchase a similar domain but using an alternative alphabet, and easily turn
- microsoft.com 
Into 
- mịcrosoft.com
- micrọsoft.com
- microsofṭ.com


A list of allowed characters can be found on the link below.
