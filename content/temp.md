👋 I have been having some fun messing around with "vibe code" over the last 2 months to understand the pros, cons of this new technology .  
I have create a few projects and during this time, here is my take on it.  
  
TLDR -  
Vibe code is great for prototyping, quick deploying not complex projects, but it will struggle with authentication and app security.
