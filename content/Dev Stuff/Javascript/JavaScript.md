# Important

1. JavaScript Execution phases
2. Memory Allocation
3. Code Execution

**Execution context** - The container where the function is running, a local variable 
inside the execution context will only exist inside the execution context.

**Hoisting** - Access variables/functions before they are defined(variables not defined before they are executed will show as not defined)

**Arrow Function** 
```
var Something = () => {console.log("Boom")}

var DoSomethingElse => {console.log("Hi")}
```
