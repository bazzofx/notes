Confidentiality = Secret, the right people
Integrity = Trustworthy, we can trust the data
Availability = Information is there when we need it

# 1.3 Security Governance
## Goals, Mission and Objectives of the Organization
Protect organization assets
Deliver value to organization stakeholders (customers, employees)
Make sure we deliver the value to the organization
Security governance is not about removing risk, is about reducing risk to a level an organization can tolerate
## Organizational Process
Understanding the process is critical to keep the work consistent across the company such as : Acquisitions, merges, divestitures, spinoffs
Governance Committees, getting a good committee of good stake holders from different department can help make a good decision.
==The process delivers the results==

## Roles and Responsibilities 
Security organization structure
Reporting Models
Budget, metrics and resources
Its always easier to help management make a decision when we present it with the money cost/savings of that decision
