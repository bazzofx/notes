# Data Exfil / C2 Detection (reportable observations)
- Monitor for large outbound `POST` / encoded blobs; tools to simulate and analyze responses: `curl`, `burp`.
- `tcpdump`/`tshark` for local traffic captures during testing (only on lab hosts).
- `Burp Collaborator` / `Interactsh` for OOB interactions (use with care/consent).
